# MangaDexTc

Not much here, it's basically just to help myself filter out Mangas when i'm trying to find something new to read. The only problem with the project itself is that it's pretty slow since i'm requesting MangaDex API everytime i need to check the chapter count for a Manga.

This project uses IndexDB, and updates data every 30 minutes by default.

## Install

`npm i`
